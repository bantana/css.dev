# Refactoring UI

Contents

## Staring from Scratch

- Start with a feature, not a layout
- Detail comes later
- Don't design too much
- Choose a personality
- Limit your choices

## Hierarchy is Everything

- Not all elements are equal
- Size isn't everything
- Don't use gray text on colored backgrounds
- Emphasize by de-emphasizing
- Labels re a last resort
- Separate visual hierarchy from document hierarchy
- Balance weight and contrast
- Semantics are secondary

## Layout and Spacing

- Start with too much white space
- Establish a spacing and sizing system
- You don't have to fill the whole screen
- Grid are overrated
- Relative sizing doesn't scale
- Avoid ambiguous spacing

## Designing Text

- Establish a type scale
- Use good fonts
- Keep your line length in check
- Baseline, not center
- Line-height is proportional
- Not every link needs a color
- Align with readability in mind
- Use letter-spacing effectively

## Working with Color

- Ditch hex for HSL
- You need more colors than you think
- Define you shades up font
- Don't let lightness kill your saturation
- Grey's don't have to be gray
- Accessible doesn't have to mean ugly
- Don't rely on color alone

## Creating Depth

- Emulate a light source
- Use shadows to convey elevation
- Shadows can have two parts
- Even flat designs can have depth
- Overlap elements to create layers

## Working with Images

- Use good photos
- Text needs consistent contrast
- Everything has an intended size
- Beware user-uploaded content

## Finishing Touches

- Supercharge the defaults
- Add color with accent borders
- Decorate your backgrounds
- Don't overlook empty states
- Use fewer borders
- Think outsize the box

## Leveling Up
